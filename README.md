Predicting photographers retouching with Deep learning


TAs said we could have two approches : 

CycleGAN-based : unsupervised learning, using cycleGAN as base, and maybe then improve the model and the performances. 

LUT-based : understand the preferred 3D transformations of the artist. Harder to pu together, but training time would be reduced. 

We should download the database mentioned in the pdfs, ~50 GBs of data. 


For the first week, we should choose an approach, and based on it, try to select few images and try to train on them (overfit as well).

Jusqu'Ã  vendredi, on on choisit une approche, et on essaie de faire 1-2 petits-trucs et voir si le projet en entier serait faisable.
